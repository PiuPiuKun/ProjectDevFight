# Adding New Characters

This documents covers the character submission.
Though you can upload as many as you need, there
is, however a limit of characters that you can actually
submit to the game itself. (aka, various concepts, only
two 'products')

# Character Rules

### IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERY CHARACTER HAS IT'S OWN COPYRIGHT
In order to keep the game balance, we ask all creators
to keep their characters "Non-Broken". As in, nothing
Over-Powered or similar. (That's what the RageDrive is
for.)

A Character Import/Submission must have ::
* The Drawings to tell how the character looks
  * Preferably a T-Pose drawing as well, for modeling

* The Submission File (Check the Character Entries)
  * Name; Title     (Example; Carlos, The Linux Loving Indie)
  * Character Modes (Normal; EX Mode Title)
  * Weapons         (Example; Swords/Guns)
  * Song List       [PLACEHOLDER]
  * Move List       [Concept Format, to be updated]
    * Name [Button Combination]
    * Description + Range
    * Damage Range
    * ~~Unlock Requirements~~
    * Requirements
    * Creator's Comments, if any
