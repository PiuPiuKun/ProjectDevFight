## Levels

The levels of the game are intended to be (most if, not all) fighting
arenas, as well as PvE for each character arc. "Dungeons" are
acceptable. Prime example; while Dissidia Focuses on Fighting, this game
(or at least the story mode) focuses on level exploration to gain
any sort of advantage to the player. Though as of current, this is just one
big idea, there is no definite version that will be completed as a1 game yet.
Thus the project is open new ideas.

# Map Size
Maps should be relatively big, like at least, 300+ft big. This is done for the
sake of exploration and interactive environment. These will let the creator make
the levels look more like it's nature.
